When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Using a remote repository would useful if you wanted to collaborate with other people on the project that you
were working on. It would also help if yiu wanted to work on your project from multiple computers as all you
would need would be an internet connection and you could then keep working on your project from any machine 
you want.
