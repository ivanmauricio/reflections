What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository you make it so that the chages in it can be tracked using git. however
just by intializing a repository it doesnt eman that your changes will automatically be tracked. you have to
choose which files you would like to track and thenn make commits of these files as you make changes to them.
